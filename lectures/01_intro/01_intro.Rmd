## What is Security?

.pull-left[

.large[**Some Working Definitions**]

- According to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/security), **security** can be defined as: **"the
quality or state of being secure: such as freedom from danger."**  

- I.e., the objective is to **protect against adversaries who would do harm whether it is intentional or not.**  

- For example, **national security** is a ``multilayered system that protects the sovereignty of
a state, its assets, its resources, and its people.'' ([Whitman and Mattford, 2022, p. 8](https://www.cengage.com/c/principles-of-information-security-7e-whitman-mattord/9780357506431/))

## What is Cyber/Information Security?

While some researchers distinguish between them, in this course, we will use both terms
**interchangeably**. Possible **definitions for cyber/information security include:**

- .bold[According to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cybersecurity), cyber security can be defined as: .red[“measures taken to protect a computer or computer system (as on the Internet) against unauthorized access or attack.”]]  

- .bold[According to the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/information-security/), “information security refers to the processes and methodologies which are designed and implemented to protect print, electronic, or any other form of confidential, private and sensitive information or data from .red[unauthorized access, use, misuse, disclosure, destruction, modification, or disruption.]"]

Suppose that I would like to start an online banking business, named Miami University Online Bank (MUOB). Assume that we have:


<div style="text-align: center; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; margin: 0 10px;">

] 
]
]


???

In the context of Miami University Online Bank (MUOB), the CIA principles - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability - can be explained with the help of the roles of Fadel (Owner), John (Customer), and Hans (Bad Guy):

- **Confidentiality:** This principle ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to view it. For MUOB, confidentiality means that customer data, such as John's account details and transaction history, should only be accessible to John and authorized MUOB personnel like Fadel. It prevents unauthorized individuals like Hans from accessing or viewing this sensitive information. Techniques to ensure confidentiality include strong authentication mechanisms, encryption, and access control measures.  

- **Integrity:** Integrity refers to maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle. For MUOB, this means ensuring that any transaction or data modification, like deposits or withdrawals made by John, is accurately recorded and unaltered. Fadel, as the owner, is responsible for implementing systems that log and verify every transaction to prevent Hans from unauthorized altering of transaction data or account balances. Tools like checksums, digital signatures, and audit trails help maintain integrity.  

- **Availability:** This principle ensures that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed. In MUOB's context, availability means that John should be able to access his account and perform transactions whenever he needs to, without interruptions. Fadel needs to ensure that the online banking system is robust, with minimal downtime, and is protected against attacks from Hans that could disrupt service, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Measures like redundant systems, regular maintenance, and strong cybersecurity defenses are vital to ensure high availability.

## Beyond the CIA: Other InfoSec Objectives

```{r run_latex_file3, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
tinytex::xelatex('../../figures/beyond_cia.tex')
Sys.sleep(2)
pdftools::pdf_convert('../../figures/beyond_cia.pdf', dpi = 600,
                      filenames = '../../figures/beyond_cia.png')
Sys.sleep(2)
```


```{r read_beyond_cia_chart, echo=FALSE, out.width='48%', fig.alt="Bubble diagram depicting key cybersecurity concepts beyond the traditional CIA Triad. Central bubble labeled 'Beyond the CIA' is surrounded by five other bubbles representing Authentication (distinguishing computer vs. network security), Authorization, Privacy, Non-repudiation, and Auditability.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../figures/beyond_cia.png")
```


???
This diagram suggests additional key concepts that are crucial in the broader scope of cybersecurity:

- **Authentication (Computer vs. Network):** This refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user or a device. It's a critical security measure to ensure that only authorized users or devices can access certain information or networks. The distinction between computer and network authentication highlights the different approaches and mechanisms required for securing individual devices (like a computer) and network access.

- **Authorization:** This concept involves granting or denying rights and permissions to access and use information or resources. After a user is authenticated, authorization determines what they are allowed to do within the system, like accessing specific files, executing commands, or reading data.

- **Privacy:** This involves protecting sensitive personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. In the context of cybersecurity, it emphasizes the need to handle and secure personal and private data, respecting user confidentiality and regulatory requirements.

- **Non-repudiation:** This principle ensures that a party in a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a message that they originated. In cybersecurity, it's crucial for maintaining the integrity of transactions and communications, often implemented through digital signatures and audit trails.

- **Auditability:** This refers to the ability to audit and review logs and records to trace and understand actions taken within a system. Effective auditability helps in detecting security violations, understanding the impact of the incidents, and improving the security posture of an organization.

By including these concepts, the chart emphasizes that a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity involves more than just the traditional CIA Triad; it also requires attention to authentication, authorization, privacy, non-repudiation, and auditability.

---

## Risk Management Controls

Effective cybersecurity **begins** with implementing diverse risk management controls, each targeting specific security aspects:

- **Administrative:** Includes the development and deployment of policies and procedures; for example:  
    * Password policies  
    * Principal of least privilege (POLP)  
    
- **Physical:** In addition to securing a firm’s premises through doors/locks/etc., typical risk
management controls utilize the:  
    * Principal of separation of duties

---

## Protocols, Host-Based Protections, and Other Key Preventive Measures

- **Protocols:** For example, the reliance on secure socket layer (SSL) to authenticate the web source  

- **Host-based protections:** secure operating systems and/or patching  

- **Access Control:** Through identification (username), authentication (over a computer/ network), and authorization (file permissions, need-to-know principle)  

- **Firewalls:** to control inter-network traffic (e.g., from/to internet)  

- **Security by design:** code reviews, unit testing, defense in depth, and principle of least privilege

This slide presents a structured breakdown of the inherent weaknesses found in increasingly complex systems and networks, categorized into three main areas: Poor Design, Poor Implementation, and Poor Management. Each category is explored with further details:

- Poor Design:  
  - This point addresses fundamental flaws in the architecture of software and hardware.  
  - An example given is 'sendmail', a widely used mail transfer agent, which has had vulnerabilities like race conditions, buffer overflows, and group permission issues. These vulnerabilities are often due to design choices that do not adequately consider security.  

- Poor Implementation:   
  - Here, the focus is on how systems are set up and maintained, highlighting that security is often not the primary concern.  
  - Factors contributing to poor implementation include a lack of experienced personnel or training, and suboptimal system configurations. For instance, default firewall configurations might leave insecure ports open, creating security risks.  

- Poor Management:  
  - This final point stresses the importance of good governance in managing IT systems.  
  - Inadequate policies and procedures can lead to systemic weaknesses, as they fail to establish a strong security culture or provide clear guidelines for maintaining security.

# Course Design, Expectations, and Overview


---

## Course Overview

Traditionally, information technology (IT) security was a job that entailed using a few tools, solutions and best practices that focused on attack prevention and protect a company’s sensitive information and network assets. However, these solutions are no longer sufficient. The businesses are transitioning to a new era, where cybersecurity is **enhanced and almost always requires data-driven analytical solutions**. The primarily goals of data-driven security are to:  
  - discover malicious patterns from the data-lakes of logs produced by security software, and   
  - develop automated tools that can assist in the surveillance of security-related data.  
  
This course covers various analytic applications in information/cyber security including: **user behavior analysis, network and host intrusion detection, web security, phishing detection, and emerging issues in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) security**. Note that the course is designed to be **very applied, involving a large amount of programming to examine real datasets.**
