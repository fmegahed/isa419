## Background: Why is BUS 104 is a Pre-Req?


### From the MU Bulletin

> .bold[BUS 104. Introduction to Computational Thinking for Business. (2)]

> As part of the Farmer School of Business first-year integrated core curriculum, this course introduces students to the fundamentals of computational thinking as an aid to data-driven business problem-solving. Topics include: computational thinking as **problem solving**, **representing data through abstractions**, and **thinking in terms of algorithms** (loops, conditions, reusable code, functions and events) to **automate finding solutions**. The course lays the foundations for students identifying, analyzing, and implementing solutions for data-driven business problems and the communication of results.

## Simplifying our Task Ahead: SYN Flood Attacks

- We will focus on the simple **SYN flood attack**.
- Attackers send a succession of SYN requests to a target's system.

.panel[.panel-name[Q5]
1. What could be some potential signs that a specific IP address is involved in a DDoS attack?   

1. How would you set a threshold to determine when an IP address should be flagged as a potential source of an attack?   

.can-edit.key-activity3e[
- **Setting a Threshold:**  Edit me.    
]
]

]

???
1. **Data Points to Collect:** Important data points to collect might include IP addresses of incoming requests, the time of each request, and the number of requests from each IP address.  

1. **Changes in Network Traffic during an Attack:** During a DDoS attack, there may be a sudden increase in the number of incoming requests from various IP addresses. To quantify these changes, you could monitor request frequency, request rate, and the total number of unique IP addresses making requests.  

1. **Time-Related Factors:** When monitoring network traffic over time, you should consider the duration of the monitoring period (time window) to observe patterns and changes. You might also consider the timestamps of incoming requests to track the rate at which requests are arriving.  

1. **Tracking Requests from the Same IP:** To keep track of requests from the same IP address, we could use a data structure like a dictionary or hash table. Each IP address could be a key, and the associated value would be the count of requests made from that IP address.  

1. **Setting a Threshold:** To flag an IP address as a potential source of a DDoS attack, you would need a threshold value representing an unusual level of traffic. If the number of requests from an IP address exceeds this threshold within the specified time window, you would flag it as a potential source of the attack.

- **Decomposition:** Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This process involves dissecting a large, complex problem into smaller, more understandable and solvable components.  

- **Pattern Recognition:** Looking for similarities among and within problems. This involves identifying patterns, trends, or common characteristics in a set of data or problems to simplify and solve them more effectively.  

- **Abstraction:** Focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail. It involves extracting the essential details about an issue or a problem, ignoring the background noise or unnecessary information.  

- **Algorithm Design:** Developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem. This is about creating a clear set of instructions or a plan that can be followed to solve a problem or perform a task.

        if ip_request_count[ip_address] exceeds threshold_limit within time_window
            `FLAG` ip_address as potential DDoS source
            `TAKE` necessary action (e.g., block IP, alert admin)

## Python Syntax: Key PEP 8 Guidelines

.pull-left[
**Indentation**
- Use .bold[4 spaces per indentation level].
- Do **not mix tabs and spaces for indentation**.

**Naming Conventions**
- .bold[Functions and variables:] `lower_case_with_underscores`
- .bold[Classes:] `CapWords` (or CamelCase)
- .bold[Constants:] `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
- Example:  

```{python, eval=F}

## Python Syntax: Key PEP 8 Guidelines

.pull-left[
**Comments**
- Write .bold[clear comments (full sentences)] for tricky parts of the code.

```{python sq, eval=F}
# Calculate the square of x (yes)
square = x ** 2  # Square value (No)
```

]


.pull-right[
**Importing Modules**
- Imports should be on separate lines.
- **Order:** standard library (e.g., `os`) $\longrightarrow$ related third-party (e.g., `pandas`) $\longrightarrow$ local application/library specific imports (e.g. from other `.py` files).

## Python Variables are Pointers, Not Buckets

- A **pointer** just represents the **connection between a variable and an objects**.

## Implications: Equality Compares Objects

Python's `==` operator checks that two objects **represent the same data** (a.k.a. **equality**):  


.pull-left[

The variables `my_numbers` and `your_numbers` point to **objects representing the same data**, but the objects they **point to are not the same**.

```{python}
my_numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7]
your_numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7]

my_numbers == your_numbers

my_numbers is your_numbers
```
]


.pull-right[

So changing one variable/object **does not** change the other:

```{python}
my_numbers[0] = 7

my_numbers == your_numbers
```


]

---

## Changing the Object will Change Both Variables

If two variables **point to the same object:**

```{python}
my_numbers_again = my_numbers
my_numbers is my_numbers_again 
```

Changing the object one variable points to **also changes** the object the other variable points to:

```{python}
my_numbers_again.append(419) #<<

print('my_numbers_again =', my_numbers_again, 'and my_numbers also =', my_numbers, '.')
```

On a positive note, this does not apply to strings and numbers (both are **immutable**).

# Manipulate Lists and Use Methods on Lists


---

## Lists in Python

- A **list** is a **mutable** sequence of elements, i.e., it can be changed after it is created.  

- Lists are created by placing elements inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.  

- Lists can contain elements of different types, including other lists.  

- Lists are **ordered** and **indexed** (i.e., you can access elements by their position).  

---

## Lists: Indexing and Slicing

.font80[
.pull-left[
- **Indexing:** Accessing individual elements in a list.  

  - Starts from 0 (for the first element) and goes up to `n-1` (for the last element).  

  - To reference the last element, you can use `-1`, and so on.  

  - You can call a particular item out of a list by using its index. For example, `my_list[0]` will return the first item in the list.  
]

.pull-right[
- **Slicing:** Accessing a subset of elements in a list, using the `:` operator, where: `my_list[start:stop:step]`.   
  - If `start` not provided, it defaults to 0   
  - If `end` is not provided, it defaults to the length of the list.  
  - If `step` is not provided, it defaults to 1.    
      * `my_list[:3]` returns the first three elements.  
      * `my_list[3:]` returns all elements from the fourth to the last.  
      *`my_list[::2]` returns every other element, and

## Python List Functions


| List Function          | Description                                           | Example                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `len()`                | Returns the length of the list.                      | `my_list = [1,2,3]` <br/> `length = len(my_list)`<br/>`# length is 3`                          |
| `max()`                | Returns the maximum value in the list.               | `my_list = [1,2,3]` <br/> `maximum = max(my_list)`<br/>`# maximum is 3`                        |
| `min()`                | Returns the minimum value in the list.               | `my_list = [1,2,3]` <br/> `minimum = min(my_list)`<br/>`# minimum is 1`                        |
| `sum()`                | Returns the sum of all elements in the list.         | `my_list = [1,2,3]` <br/> `total = sum(my_list)`<br/>`# total is 6`                            |
| `sort()`               | Sorts the list in ascending order.                   | `my_list = [3,2,1]` <br/> `my_list.sort()`<br/>`# my_list is now [1, 2, 3]`                     |

## Class Activity: List Manipulation

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 0, top = 0, font_size = "2em")`

```{python generate_log_data, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
import random
import datetime

# List of possible log levels
log_levels = ["INFO", "ERROR", "WARNING"]

# List of usernames for simulation
usernames = ["alice", "bob", "charlie", "dave", "eve", "frank", "grace", "harry"]

# List of IP addresses for simulation
ip_addresses = ["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.101", "192.168.1.102", "192.168.1.103"]

# Create and open a sample log file for writing
with open("../../data/simulated_logs.txt", "w") as file:
    for _ in range(1000):  # Generate 1000 log entries
        log_time = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(minutes=random.randint(1, 60*24*365))
        log_level = random.choice(log_levels)
        username = random.choice(usernames)
        ip_address = random.choice(ip_addresses)
        message = f"User '{username}' logged in successfully." if log_level == "INFO" else f"Access denied for user '{username}' from IP address {ip_address}."
        
        log_entry = f"[{log_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] {log_level}: {message}\n"
        file.write(log_entry)
```

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Task]

In pairs, build on the code below to:

```{python activity_task, eval=FALSE}
# your path will be different
with open("../../data/simulated_logs.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Strip newline characters from each line
log_entries = [line.strip() for line in lines]
type(log_entries)
```

1. Show how to get the **total number of log entries**.  
1. Show how to slice the **first 5 log entries**.  
1. **Filter out all** log entries that contain the word **ERROR**.  
1. **Count** the number of **ERROR** entries.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Solution]

In [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or your favorite Python environment), write code to address the questions in the previous tab.

```{python activity_solution, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
with open("../../data/simulated_logs.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

log_entries = [line.strip() for line in lines]
type(log_entries)


# Number of log entries
total_entries = len(log_entries)

# First 5 log entries
first_five_entries = log_entries[:5]

# Filter out ERROR entries (list comprehension)
# [expression for item in iterable if condition]
error_entries = [entry for entry in log_entries if "ERROR" in entry]

# Another way to filter out ERROR entries
log_entries_copy = []
for entry in log_entries:
    if "ERROR" in entry:
        log_entries_copy.append(entry)

log_entries_copy == error_entries  # True

# A third way
non_error_entries = 0
for entry in log_entries:
    if "ERROR" not in entry:
        non_error_entries += 1


# Count the number of ERROR entries
num_error_entries = len(error_entries)
print(num_error_entries)
print(len(log_entries_copy))
non_error_entries + len(error_entries) == total_entries  # True
```
