# ISA 419: An Undergrad Course on Data-Driven Security
This repo contains my lecture notes (created in R Markdown) for an undergraduate business intelligence and data visualization course. The course is divided into two main phases:  
  - **Phase 1: Building your Analytics Toolbox** covers the foundational aspects of cybersecurity and Python programming basics. Students will learn about the structure and goals of information security, get hands-on experience with Python for data analysis, and dive into data quality checks and visualization techniques.  
  - **Phase 2: Applications**, which delves into the application of machine learning to cybersecurity challenges. It includes advanced topics such as clustering, regression, classification models, and communication of machine learning model results. Students will also tackle specific security topics like phishing detection and web server log analysis, culminating in the time reserved for final projects.
